# Filip's Arch Config Files And Scripts -- WORK IN PROGRESS

# Saving System Configs/Scripts/Dots
The **action.sh** contains a variety of functions to help apply various configurations to your system (or save new changes). (It's still currently under progress)

### TO DO
- Post Install Tasks e.g. 
    - Sudoers
    - Segment more of the scripts to be easure to call on
    - Change default shell to zsh
    - Put files in the relevant directories
    - Pull out all the directories/mappings into separate file to be called on
    - Allow script to be curl'ed directly from the github and executed
    - Change copy_local and deploy_config functions to sit together. Use variables to interchange the source and destination of the copy procedure.
