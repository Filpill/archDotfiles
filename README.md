# Filpill's Automatic Arch Rice Deployment

The **.config** folder contains configuration for various programs.
The **.local/bin** folder contain custom shell scripts.
The **.local/share/fonts** folder contain fonts I use.

### Installation Instructions

Run the below commands to download Arch Linux Desktop Environment

After install is complete, you can exit out of root (back to tty) and login as user. The x server should start automatically and execute dwm alongside.
